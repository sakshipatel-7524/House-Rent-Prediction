During my internship at Brainy Beam Technologies, I undertook a project focused on predicting house rent using advanced machine learning models. This project aimed to create a robust predictive system that could accurately estimate rental prices based on various influential factors.

The dataset used for this project included a range of parameters such as:
- Area: The size of the property in square feet.
- Number of Bedrooms: The total number of bedrooms in the property.
- Furnishing Status: Whether the property is furnished, semi-furnished, or unfurnished.
- Location: The geographical location of the property.
- Amenities: Availability of additional facilities like parking, gym, swimming pool, etc.

Key steps in the project included:
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the dataset to identify trends, correlations, and insights that could inform model selection and feature engineering.
3. Model Development: Implementing and training various machine learning models, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests, to predict rental prices.
4. Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the models using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and R-squared score to select the best-performing model.
5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the chosen model's performance through techniques such as grid search and cross-validation.
6. Visualization: Creating visualizations to present the results and insights derived from the model, making it easier to understand the key factors affecting rental prices.

The final deliverable was a Jupyter notebook containing the entire workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, along with visualizations to illustrate the findings. Additionally, I have uploaded a CSV file containing sample data used in the project.

This project not only enhanced my technical skills in machine learning and data analysis but also provided practical experience in solving real-world problems using data-driven approaches.
